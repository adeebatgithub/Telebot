Hai,
Welcome to my territory.

first of all my name is KURUKKAN and i am a BOT.
currently i have only one duty, to remove forward tag from files,
maybe in the future i may have more than one duty.

Now let's look at which commands i can understand.
first one and most important one is "/help" command
in there you can find commands and what they do.

coming to my duty,
i'll tell you how to remove the forward tag of a media file.
step-1 : forward a media file to me.
step-2 : select Remove forward tag from the options
And i'll send you the file without forward tag.

Hope i'm useful for you, Enjoy my service.
